<!-- 
Purpose: demonstrate how callback functions are executed
Example adapted from Andrew Mead's "The Complete Node.js Developer Course"
on Udemy

Takeaway: the zeroSecondTimer executes after the console.log('Stop'), which
counterintuitive since it's paused for zero seconds.  The reason why it's
executed after 'stop' is because asynchronous functions have to be sent to
the callback queue 

Note, this code is put into a .html file so that it can easily be run in
Chrome, enabling easy use of debugging.
